# Semester 2 - Software
*Note: This README might be less detailed than other repositories since I'm writing this a year later. Also the documents are in Dutch.*

## What did I make this semester? 

### Web Application
I created a web application wherein teachers can create tests and assign them to a class of students. Next up the teacher can also grade each student on the test that was just created. The repository of my application is private because it showed passwords everywhere.

### Lots of Diagrams
In this semester you will be forced to make: use-cases, contextdiagram, conceptual model, user stories, class diagram, domain model, database architecture. Just a lot. You might find them back inside my [Architecture Document](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/software-semester-2/blob/main/documents/Architectuurdocument%20-%20Kaan%20Gogcay.docx) and my [Analyse Document](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/software-semester-2/blob/main/documents/Analysedocument%20-%20Kaan%20Gogcay.docx)
