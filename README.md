# Semester 2 - Software
*Note: This README might be less detailed than other repositories since I'm writing this a year later. Also the documents are in Dutch.*

## What did I make this semester? 

### Web Application
I created a web application wherein teachers can create tests and assign them to a class of students. Next up the teacher can also grade each student on the test that was just created. The repository of my application is private because it showed passwords everywhere.

### Lots of Diagrams
In this semester you will be forced to make: use-cases, contextdiagram, conceptual model, user stories, class diagram, domain model, database architecture. Just a lot. You might find them back inside my [Architecture Document](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/software-semester-2/blob/main/documents/Architectuurdocument%20-%20Kaan%20Gogcay.docx) and my [Analyse Document](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/software-semester-2/blob/main/documents/Analysedocument%20-%20Kaan%20Gogcay.docx)

### Algorithm Exercises
This was the fun part of the semester. I made 2 exercises inside this semester involving Algorithmics. Both of them are a variation on classic sorting algorithms.

## What did I find hard this semester?
Here are topics I struggled with this semester

### ASP.NET
Creating a web application using ASP.NET was one of the biggest struggles. If you can't seem to understand ASP.NET you won't make it. Mainly struggled to redirect pages from one to another, give parameters when going from one to another, stuff like that.

### Dependency Inversion
This is just a magic trick. I can understand why the concept is usefull, but I don't understand why it's even possible and don't understand how to do it till this day. Ask your teacher for examples on this one.

## What do others find hard this semester?
I asked other people what they found hard about semester 2 and this is what they answered.
